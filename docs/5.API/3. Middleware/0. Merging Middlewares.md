# ✅ Middleware Merging Strategy

This outlines how two router trees with nested middlewares are **intelligently merged** to preserve execution order and structure.

---

## 🔹 **Before Merging**

### 🧭 **Root Router Tree (`RootMiddlewares`)**

```plaintext
RootMiddlewares
└── "/test"                             # path
    ├── middlewares: [m1]              # existing middleware
    └── children:
        └── "/test/1"
            ├── middlewares: [m2]
```

* `/test`: Contains middleware `[m1]`.
* `/test/1`: A subroute with its own middleware `[m2]`.

---

## 🔹 **New Router Tree to Merge (`RouterMiddlewares`)**

### 🌱 **Incoming Subrouter**

```plaintext
RouterMiddlewares
└── "/test"
    ├── middlewares: [m3]              # additional middleware to merge
    └── children:
        └── "/test/2"
            ├── middlewares: [m4]
```

* `/test`: New middleware `[m3]` for same path.
* `/test/2`: New child route under `/test`.

---

## 🔁 **After Merging (`RootMiddlewares`)**

```plaintext
RootMiddlewares
└── "/test"
    ├── middlewares: [m1, m3]          # merged middlewares
    └── children:
        ├── "/test/1"
        │   ├── middlewares: [m2]
        └── "/test/2"
            ├── middlewares: [m4]      # newly added
```

* Middleware arrays are **merged**: `[m1] + [m3] → [m1, m3]`.
* All existing children remain untouched (`/test/1`).
* New children are **appended** (`/test/2`).

---

## 🧠 **Implementation Behavior**

### 🔧 `when` API

```ts
/**
 * Registers a route or middleware stack for a specific HTTP method.
 *
 * @param method - HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "POST", "ALL" for middleware).
 * @param path - Path to match (e.g., "/api", "/test").
 * @param handlers - Array of middleware or route handler functions.
 */
when(method: HttpMethod | HttpMethod[], path: string, handlers: Handler[]): void;
```

* `method = "ALL"` implies middleware, applied to all requests for that path.
* Used internally when adding reusable or nested routers.

---

## 🧱 **Automatic Middleware Registration Logic**

When merging routes via a registry:

```ts
if (middlewares?.length) {
  this.#addRoute("ALL", path, middlewares);
}
```

* Ensures **all middleware layers** from incoming routers are preserved.
* Middleware at the same path is concatenated, not replaced.
