# 🚀 Benchmarking Performance: TezX Across Runtimes

TezX is built for speed and efficiency, supporting multiple JavaScript runtimes. This section highlights real-world HTTP server benchmarks comparing TezX performance on **Bun**, **Deno**, and **Node.js** using `wrk`, a popular HTTP benchmarking tool.

---

## ⚙️ Test Setup

* **Benchmark Tool:** [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) (v4.1+)
* **Test Duration:** 10 seconds
* **Threads:** 12
* **Concurrent Connections:** 400
* **Endpoint:** `/` (simple text response)
* **Ports:** Bun & Deno on `3001`, Node.js on `3000`

## 💡 Insights

* **Bun** demonstrates exceptional throughput and low latency, benefiting from its highly optimized JavaScript runtime and native HTTP server.
* **Deno** performs admirably, striking a balance between speed and robustness with modern runtime features.
* **Node.js** remains a solid choice but shows higher latency and lower request capacity under heavy concurrency.

---

## 📈 Why Does This Matter?

* **High Throughput:** Enables TezX to handle thousands of requests per second, ideal for real-time apps and APIs.
* **Low Latency:** Improves user experience by reducing response delays.
* **Runtime Flexibility:** TezX runs efficiently on multiple platforms — choose the runtime that best fits your deployment needs.
