# PoweredBy Middleware

## Overview

The `poweredBy` middleware is a simple utility that adds an `X-Powered-By` HTTP header to responses. It allows customization of the server name, with a default value of `TezX`.

## Features

- Adds an `X-Powered-By` header to every response.
- Allows an optional custom server name.
- Lightweight and efficient middleware.

## Installation

Ensure your project is set up to use this middleware in an Express-like environment or a framework that supports middleware functions.

## Usage

### Import the `poweredBy` Middleware

```ts
import { poweredBy } from "tezx/middleware";
```

### Apply the Middleware

```ts
app.use(poweredBy("MyServer"));
```

## Function Signature

```ts
export const poweredBy = (serverName?: string): Middleware;
```

### Parameters

- `serverName` _(optional, string)_: Custom name for the `X-Powered-By` header. Defaults to `TezX`.

### Return Value

Returns a middleware function that sets the `X-Powered-By` header.

## Implementation Details

1. Sets the `X-Powered-By` header on the response.
2. Uses the provided `serverName` or defaults to `TezX`.
3. Proceeds to the next middleware in the stack.

## Example Response Header

```
X-Powered-By: MyServer
```

## Notes

- Ensure this middleware is included early in the middleware stack to guarantee header presence.
- Customizing the `X-Powered-By` value can help with branding or security measures.
