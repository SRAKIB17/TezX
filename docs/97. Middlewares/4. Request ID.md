# Request ID Middleware

## Overview

The `requestID` middleware assigns a unique request ID to each incoming request. This helps with request tracking, debugging, and logging.

## Features

- Assigns a unique request ID to each request.
- Uses an existing request ID from headers if available.
- Stores the request ID in the request context for easy access.
- Sets the request ID in the response headers.

## Installation

Ensure your project is set up to use this middleware in an Express-like environment or a framework that supports middleware functions.

## Usage

### Import the `requestID` Middleware

```ts
import { requestID } from "tezx/middleware";
```

### Apply the Middleware

```ts
app.use(requestID());
```

## Function Signature

```ts
export const requestID = (headerName?: string): Middleware;
```

### Parameters

- `headerName` _(optional, string)_: Custom header name for the request ID. Defaults to `"X-Request-ID"`.

### Return Value

Returns a middleware function that assigns and tracks request IDs.

## Implementation Details

1. Checks if the request already has an ID in the specified header.
2. If not, generates a new request ID using `generateID()`.
3. Stores the request ID in `ctx.state` for easy access.
4. Adds the request ID to the response headers.
5. Proceeds to the next middleware in the stack.

## Example Response Header

```bash
X-Request-ID: req-123456789
```

## Notes

- Ensure this middleware is included early in the stack to track all requests.
- Customizing the header name allows flexibility in integration with different systems.
- Using a consistent request ID helps in debugging and tracing requests across services.
