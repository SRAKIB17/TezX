# Logger Middleware

## Overview

The `logger` middleware is a utility for logging HTTP requests in a structured and color-coded format. It captures and logs details such as request method, pathname, status, and execution time.

## Features

- Logs incoming HTTP requests with method and pathname.
- Captures execution time for each request.
- Displays status codes upon response completion.
- Handles and logs errors encountered during request processing.

## Usage

### Import the `logger` Middleware

```ts
import { logger } from "tezx/middleware";
```

### Apply the Middleware

```ts
app.use(logger());
```

### Return Value

Returns a middleware function that logs request details and execution time.

## Implementation Details

1. Logs the incoming request method and pathname.
2. Captures the start time before executing the next middleware.
3. Calls `await next()` to process the request.
4. Computes execution time after response processing.
5. Logs response details including method, pathname, status code, and execution time.
6. Handles and logs errors if encountered during execution.

## Example Output

```
<-- GET /api/data
--> GET /api/data 200 45.32ms
```

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during middleware execution, it:

- Logs the error details to the console.
- Throws the error to be handled by upstream middleware.
